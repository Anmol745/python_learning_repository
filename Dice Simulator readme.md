# 🎲 Python Dice Simulator Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python-based dice simulation projects created during my initial learning phase of Python programming, it conatains multipe customizations done by me showcasing my skill to add new features in a project.

The purpose of these projects was to strengthen:
- Python fundamentals
- Logic building
- Use of built-in libraries like `random`
- Handling user input and game logic

Each folder represents a different version or customization of a dice-based game, gradually increasing in complexity.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Functions
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Lists & Dictionaries
- User input handling
- Random number generation

## 🚀 How to Run
Navigate to any project folder and run:
```bash
python Stimulating Dice.py
