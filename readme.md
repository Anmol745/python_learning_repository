# 🐍 Python Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects that I created during my initial days of learning Python.

The main goal of these projects was to:
- Understand Python fundamentals
- Practice logic building
- Learn and experiment with important Python libraries
- Gain confidence by building small, working programs

Each project in this repository represents a step in my learning journey.
